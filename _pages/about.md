Hi!

I am a PhD candidate at [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/) (LUH) under the supervision of Thomas Seel. My research focuses on state estimation in vehicles, with a particular emphasis on data-driven estimation methods and the transferability of learned models across different vehicles.

I hold an M\.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering and an M\.Sc. in Mechatronics and Robotics from [Leibniz University Hannover](https://www.uni-hannover.de/en/). I wrote my master’s thesis on nonlinear model predictive control for soft robotic systems.

Prior to my graduate studies, I completed a dual study program and earned a B.Eng. in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Applied Sciences Münster](https://www.fh-muenster.de/en/), in cooperation with [Schmitz Cargobull AG](https://www.cargobull.com/en), following the German dual education pathway that combines vocational training with academic studies. During this program, I qualified as a Mechatronics Technician, rotated through several R&D departments, and later joined the company full-time as a System Development Engineer for vehicle brake systems and electrical architectures.

My research interests include state estimation using model-based and data-driven methods, especially neural network based approaches. I am also interested in learning-based control including MPC, kinematic and dynamic modeling, and machine learning more broadly.
